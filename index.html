A SMARTER WAY TO LEARN HTML & CSS
CHAPTER 1 EXERCISE 19

This is JS Fiddle, a "coding sandbox" where you write HTML code and see it run. You'll be using it throughout these lessons for live practice.

Notice that in addition to the menu on the left, the page consists of four separate panes defined by blue lines. This pane, the one where you're reading, is the pane in which you write HTML code.

STEP 1: The first four characters on line 16 below are <!--. I've put them there to disable the code so it can't run. Enable the code by deleting the four characters.

STEP 2: See where it says "Run" in the menu above? Click it now. Watch the "Result" pane on the right to see what happens.

(Find a copy of the completed assignment at http://jsfiddle.net/ASmarterWayToLearn/b31rfdfz/)
-->

<!-- <p>You clicked "Run" and the code starting with &lt;p> from the pane on the left produced this result. This pane, the "Result" pane, simulates a small browser window that responds to the code you write.</p>
<p>The explanatory text above the &lt;p> didn't run, because it's enclosed by &lt;!-- and<br>--&gt;. Text enclosed by &lt;!-- and --&gt; isn't readable by the browser. It's just for human readers.</p>
<p>Don't worry about the details of the HTML code now. I just want you to get a general idea about how JS Fiddle works.</p>
